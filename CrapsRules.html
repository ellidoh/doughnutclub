			A player rolls two dice. Each die has six faces that contain
			one, two, three, four, five and six spots, respectively. The 
			sum of the spots on the two upward faces is calculated. If the
			sum is 7 or 11 on the first throw, the player wins. If the sum
			is 2, 3 or 12 on the first throw (called "craps"), the player 
			loses (i.e., the "house" wins). If the sum is 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 
			10 on the first throw, that sum becomes the player’s "point." 
			To win, you must continue rolling the dice until you "make your
			point" (i.e., roll your point value). You lose by rolling a 7 
			before making the point.
