Course work from CIS 393

Many of these files exist from assignments during this particular class.  
Many existing features meet no less than the minimum requirements of the course, which focused less on the back-end, and more on 
the front-end.  The menu was repurposed from menu code I first found online (I forget the original source, but it was 
a pure CSS menu).  I first used this code for some Java web apps I worked on while employed at Bradley.  I then repurposed it for this 
class project, customizing it as appropriate.

Although there is an option to sign in, the cgi code does not store anything into the session.  

The draw.js file is unaltered by me, and is entirely code provided by Deitel.
The craps code is almost entirely original code from Deitel.  I modified it to hide unused buttons.  
Why should there be a "Roll" button and a "Play" button when only one can be used at a time?
  I have considered furthere modifications, as I dislike the lag while pictures are loading. Surely this can be optimized somehow?

Since creating this github account, I have returned to this project, creating a basic lights-out gamed.  Presently it is simpler 
than a version I created in VB6 years ago, but with effort I could replicate what I can recall of this version I created.  I have 
utilized both basic Javascript and jQuery to create this game.
